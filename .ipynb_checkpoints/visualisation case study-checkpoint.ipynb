    "This case study will focus on the price and the four C's of diamond grade. AIm is to answer the question about the degree of importance of these quality measures has on the pricing of a diamond.\n",

    "The dataset contains 54,000 rows and 10 columns.\n",

    "* price: Price in dollars. Data was collected in 2008.\n",
    "* carat: Diamond weight. 1 carat is equal to 0.2 grams.\n",
    "* cut: Quality of diamond cut, affects its shine. Grades go from (low) Fair, Good, Very Good, Premium, Ideal (best).\n",
    "* color: Measure of diamond coloration. Increasing grades go from (some color) J, I, H, G, F, E, D (colorless).\n",
    "* clarity: Measure of diamond inclusions. Increasing grades go from (inclusions) I1, SI2, SI1, VS2, VS1, VVS2, VVS1, IF (internally flawless).\n",
    "* x, y, z: Diamond length, width, and depth, respectively, in mm.\n",
    "* table: Ratio of width of top face of diamond to its overall width, as a percentage.\n",
    "* depth: Proportional depth of diamond, as a percentage. This is computed as 2 * z / (x + y), or the ratio of the depth to the average of length and width."
